Simple game engine written in C++.
This engines main focus is compatibility for most New and old platforms.
Engine is mainly for 2D games but has 3d elements. Further 3D support planned.

In this engine you mostly do everything using code.
There is Level editor planned since its hard to make levels using just code.

Engine architecture is based on Hazel engine.

Note From the author
 --------------------
- If you are going to use this game engine, pls support as much platform as possible (eh. You do not have to support Chrome OS or FreeBSD) and support more architectures like x86_32, x86_64, aarch64. You do not have to that but if you do it you would make me happi. :3
